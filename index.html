<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<p>I have lived in Spokane Washington my whole life. I have loved art since I was a kid and have always enjoyed exploring new things.
    I am now majoring in Visual Communication Design to hopefully persue my passion for art and design. My main goal in this program is to get a certificate
in animation to hopefully be an animator / motion designer.</p>
 
<h2>Super Power</h2>

<p>I could eat enough food for a family of 4.</p>
